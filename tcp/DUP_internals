1 What is DUP
Driver Update Packages from Red Hat implement a mechanism whereby
system drivers (and other loadable Linux kernel modules) may be added
to, or updated on, existing installations of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Such
drivers can be pre-compiled and distributed (along with source) in the form
of regular RPM packages that users may install easily onto their systems,
without requiring build tools or specialist knowledge concerning the kernel.

2 DUP schedule
During planing phase the customer will file a ystream bug to request a driver
update to enable new hardware or critical bug fix, and our ystream developer
will fix the bug before beta. At the same time the customer can raise a DUP
request based on this ystream bug, and we will start to build it after beta.
After we have local build DUP iso, we will ask the customer and QE to test to
see if it works as we expect. Once we get positive feedback from customer and
QE, we will imoprt the srpm into dist-git, and build it in brew. Then we will
create an errata to track it, and add build into errata, and transfer to QE
once we finish the "RPMDiff Tests". QE will go on their TPS test and release
it.

3 DUP request
The customer will file a DUP request based on their needs, and our DUP PM and
manager and developer will evaluate whether we can approve their request.
Basically a valid DUP request should meet following requirements:
a) it enables new hardware
b) it should be filed before beta
c) the corresponding ystream bug must be fixed before beta
d) it is better not involve changes of middle layer module

4 DUP workflow
a) evaluate customer's DUP request
b) local build and test
c) ask the customer and QE to test local build DUP iso
d) add srpm into dist-git and build it in brew
e) create errata
f) add brew build into errata and finish "RPMDiff Tests"
g) transfer to QE and go on with TPS test and release.

6 related tools/packages
anaconda, kmod, redhat-rpm-config, kernel-abi-whitelists redhat-rpm-config kernel-devel
genisoimage createrepo

7 local build and test
git clone git://git.engineering.redhat.com/users/wpan/rhel7-dup.git
cd rhel7-dup
The whole work should be done in redhat/dup/,

a) redhat/dup/Makefile 
It is the main make to control the DUP build process,
and it runs according to the paramenters that you specify on the command line.

b) redhat/dup/Makefile.firmware
It is the makefile to build driver firmware sub-package,
some driver will needs firmware to work.

c) redhat/dup/Makefile.sources
There are several keywords that you should specify,
assume the driver name is DRIVERXXX,

DUP_SOURCE_DRIVERXXX
We should specify all the source codes here,

DUP_VERSION_DRIVERXXX
We should specify the version of driver here.
If the driver does not have a version in its source codes,
please refer to the doc [7].

DUP_SYMVERS_DRIVERXXX
This driver may depend on the symbol versions that provided by other drivers,
we should specify them here.

DUP_FIRMWARE_DRIVERXXX
This driver may need some firmware files, and we can specify them here.
In RHEL7, firmware files can be found in brew (or in the official git repo), 
search "linux-firmware" package, then put them in your repo.

DUP_FIRMWARE_VERSION_DRIVERXXX
We can specify the version of the firmware package.

d) three template files
redhat/dup/template.files
redhat/dup/template.spec
redhat/dup/template.conf
Other scripts (like Makefile) will modify them and convert them.

e) redhat/dup/makefiles/
If the driver needs a special makefile, put it here.

f) redhat/dup/patches/
If the driver needs a patch, put it here.

g) redhat/dup/greylists/
We store the greylist files here.

h) redhat/dup/symvers/
We store the symbol version files here.
If we are a middle layer module, and if we will export symbols to be used by upper
modules, then we should put the symbol version files here.

i) redhat/dup/gengreylist.sh
It will be called to generate greylist if we specify "update-greylist" in the command line,
make -f redhat/dup/Makefile DUP_DRIVER=bnx2x update-greylist
And the output is saved in 
redhat/dup/greylists/bnx2x/symbols.greylist-x86_64

j) four files will be contained in rpm
redhat/dup/depmodconf
redhat/dup/find-requires.ksyms
redhat/dup/find-provides.ksyms
redhat/dup/kmodtool

k) redhat/dup/create_disk.sh
It can take *.rpm as paramenter and package them as an iso.
It needs command like mkisofs and createrepo.

8 brew build and test
a) check whether there is a git repo for that driver in dist-git,
or file a ticket to releng to create the repo.
b) check whether there is correct branch in that repo, or file a ticket to
releng to create the branch.
c) rhpkg switch-branch XXX
d) rhpkg import YYY.srpm
e) git commit and specify "Resolves: bz#"
f) rhpkg push
g) rhpkg build, then the rpms are in brew now

9 errata
a) file a DUP errata and use the old ones as template
b) add "Builds". In this step you may ask releng for help.
c) finish the "Rpmdiff" test
d) modify the state as "QE" and transfer to QE
f) QE will go on the errata test and release it

10 DUP testing
In most cases DUP will handle driver to enable new hardware,
and we may not have such new hardware, then we will ask the customer to help
me test it.

And if we have old hardware that needs the same driver, QE will test it on the
old hardware to see if the DUP iso works and wether there is regression.

11 Workflow example:

1 background
This task is to create a DUP iso to test the DUP infrastructure in RHEL7.1
beta, so we should provision RHEL-7.1-20141203.0 Server x86_64, and the kernel
is 3.10.0-210.el7.x86_64.

Since the latest tag in kernel git repo is kernel-3.10.0-215.el7,
then we will build bnx2x driver based on codes in kernel-3.10.0-215.el7, 
and test it on 3.10.0-210.el7.x86_64.

2 install releated packages
yum -y install kernel-abi-whitelists redhat-rpm-config kernel-devel genisoimage createrepo

3 clone DUP git repo and pull the latest codes from kernel git repo
git clone git://git.engineering.redhat.com/users/wpan/rhel7-dup.git
cd rhel7-dup/
git pull git://git.app.eng.bos.redhat.com/rhel7

4 since bnx2x needs firmware files, get them from brew,
wget http://download.devel.redhat.com/brewroot/packages/linux-firmware/20140911/0.1.git365e80c.el7/noarch/linux-firmware-20140911-0.1.git365e80c.el7.noarch.rpm
rpm2cpio linux-firmware-20140911-0.1.git365e80c.el7.noarch.rpm |cpio -div
move bnx2x-e1-7.10.51.0.fw, bnx2x-e1h-7.10.51.0.fw and bnx2x-e2-7.10.51.0.fw to rhel7-dup/firmware/bnx2x

5 modify Makefile.sources
Append the following to redhat/dup/Makefile.sources,
#bnx2x (bz#1124971)

DUP_SOURCE_bnx2x= \
drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnx2x/* \
drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/cnic_if.h
DUP_VERSION_bnx2x="1.710.51"
DUP_FIRMWARE_bnx2x= \
firmware/bnx2x/bnx2x-e1-7.10.51.0.fw \
firmware/bnx2x/bnx2x-e1h-7.10.51.0.fw \
firmware/bnx2x/bnx2x-e2-7.10.51.0.fw
DUP_FIRMWARE_VERSION_bnx2x="7.10.51"

6 test build to see if there is build error,
if we meet error, we should cork a patch to fix it.

make -f redhat/dup/Makefile DUP_DRIVER=bnx2x rpm

7 generate greylist with following command,
make -f redhat/dup/Makefile DUP_DRIVER=bnx2x update-greylist

PS if we will provide symbol version files to other drivers,
we should also generate symver files with following command,

make -f redhat/dup/Makefile DUP_DRIVER=bnx2x update-symvers

In most cases we can skip this step.

8 contain the generated greylist and rebuild,
make -f redhat/dup/Makefile DUP_DRIVER=bnx2x rpm

9 generate DUP iso
mkdir ~/bnx2x
cp /root/rhel7-dup/redhat/dup/tmp/SRPMS/bnx2x-1.710.51-1.el7.src.rpm /root/rhel7-dup/redhat/dup/tmp/RPMS/x86_64/kmod-bnx2x-firmware-1.710.51-1.el7.x86_64.rpm /root/rhel7-dup/redhat/dup/tmp/RPMS/x86_64/kmod-bnx2x-1.710.51-1.el7.x86_64.rpm ~/bnx2x

./redhat/dup/create_disk.sh ~/bnx2x/*.rpm
It will generate dd.iso in the current directory 
mv dd.iso ~/bnx2x/ and you can rename it and deliver it to QE.
