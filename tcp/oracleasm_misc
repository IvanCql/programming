1 what it oracleasm
Oracle ASM (Automated Storage Management) is a data volume manager for
Oracle databases. ASMLib is an optional utility that can be used on Linux
systems to manage Oracle ASM devices. ASMLib consists of the following
components:

 - kmod-oracleasm (open-source (GPL) kernel module package)
 - oracleasm-support (open-source (GPL) utilities package)
 - oracleasmlib (proprietary library package)

komd-oracleasm (ASMlib kernel module) will ship separately from the kernel
package, and DUP only covers kmod-oracleasm package.

2 when should we rebuild it
kmod-oracleasm will be built for each minor release, 
and it depends on the GA kernel version of
each minor release and it can be used by future zstream.

For example, customer create RHEL66z kmod-oracleasm package
request via BZ 1063526 when RHEL66 is in progress.  This package will be built
out when RHEL66 GA kernel is ready and deliver to QE and customer at the same
time.  The RH QE (functional and package level) and customer will start to
test it together. Meanwhile, RH devel will create errata for this package.
Kernel qe will handle errata process and release it after get the positive
functional testing result from Afom and customer's testing feedback.
Normally, this package will be released after GA release in 3 weeks(including
dist-git, build, functional/package testing, errata, etc).

3 oracleasm git repo
oracleasm git repo is maintained by Oracle,
git://oss.oracle.com/git/oracleasm.git

For Oracle Linux 7 (RHEL7), it is added into their kernel tree,
git://oss.oracle.com/git/linux-uek3-3.8.git 
drivers/block/oracleasm/

4 how to build it

a) find the latest oracleasm rpm package in brew
b) pull the new patches from oracle git repo
c) rebuild oracleasm against minor release GA
d) test
e) build it in brew
f) release it via errata

ps do not forget to modify SOURCES/oracleasm.preamble

5 testing

Currently, kernel qe team is co-working with "Afom Michael"
<tmichael@redhat.com> on "oracleasm" feature testing.
Test case:
https://tcms.engineering.redhat.com/plan/3614/rhel-dup-errata#testcases

And QE will handle the errata test.
